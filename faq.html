					<h3>Can I really take it online?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">YES! After years of having to sit in an ABC class to get a server permit in Tennessee the TABC has finally approved online server training! We are one of the first courses approved! Sign up here to get a server permit!</p>

					<h3>But I thought that online classes were only for cashiers at gas stations and grocery stores. Is this what this is?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">We totally understand your skepticism, and you’re right: that USED to be true. Until March 15, 2019, that was the only “online ABC class.” But now the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commissions (TABC) has approved what are called “liquor-by-the-drink” alcohol server permit classes that can be taken ONLINE, from wherever you want, whenever you want, and we have one of the first ones available in Tennessee. If you don’t believe us, call the TABC yourself at 615.741.1602.</p>

				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">Our program works on all browsers and devices, including phones and tablets. If you do experience technical difficulties, it may be helpful to clear your history, refresh your browser, and the generally recognized recommended browsers for online learning programs are Firefox and Google Chrome. And, of course a strong internet connection is helpful. If you have other technical issues, email us at tnabccards@gmail.com - we will get your problem resolved quickly.</p>

					<h3>Ok. I passed my test. What happens now?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">Once you pass your test, we submit your score and your RLPS number to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Then they approve it. We can’t make any guarantees as to how long that will take, but since they’ve moved their operations online too, it has not taken more than a week usually, and sometimes it only takes a day or two. We are submitting scores to them daily. Once they’ve accepted and approved your results that we sent them, they will send you an email notifying you that your ABC Card is ready to download from your RLPS account that you created with the state. After that, we recommend downloading a pdf of the card and saving it to your phone for your own personal record and attaching it to an email that you send to your manager, so the establishment you work at has a record and can be in compliance.</p>

					<h3>Why do I have to do this? What are we going to learn?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">The Server Training and Responsibility Act of 1995 mandates that all persons serving alcohol in the state of Tennessee undergo state approved training. The course covers problems and problem solving techniques often associated with alcohol consumption. We will cover identifying problem drinkers, appropriate intervention strategies, server liability, minor identification and much more. Tennessee ABC cards was designed by industry veterans with an understanding of the practical and legal knowledge servers of alcohol need to be successful. We think you will find this state mandated training insightful and knowledgeable.</p>

					<h3>Do you offer classes in-person?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">We used to have in-person classes almost every day. However, we are now primarily operating, maintaining, and monitoring the online course, because we think that is the way most people would prefer it. If you have a large group, like if you’re an owner or manager and want to make SURE that your employees get through the whole class and have their cards, we can do an in-person class for you, but it would have to be at least 10 people. Email us at <a href="mailto:tnabccards@gmail.com">tnabccards@gmail.com</a> or call us at <a href="tel:6155022240">615.502.2240</a> and leave us a message, and we’ll work with you to put that together.</p>

					<h3>Who are you? Who’s going to be teaching me this stuff?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="border rounded d-flex flex-column faq-answer">
					<p class="mt-auto p-3">We are Tennessee ABC Cards, LLC. We used to be Nashville Server Permits, LLC. We changed that because, now that classes are online, we can reach and teach people all over the state. But, the truth is, this company was started by two veterans of the restaurant industry, in Nashville and across the country. Between the two of us, we have over 30 years of alcohol service experience. Like all people in this industry, waiting tables and bartending are not all we do. One of us is an attorney and both of us are musicians. But most importantly for you, we know a lot about the restaurant and bar industry, and we share that information with you in our classes, teaching you the state-required material in a way that you can use in your profession.</p>
